# Plot the Runtimes of Binary search and Linear search

- This program uses matplot library to display the differing runtime complexities of Binary and Linear search.
- Binary and Linear algorithms are implemented
- A file is read: it contains increasingly large lines of sorted numbers
- The search algorithms are run on each line, and timed respectively
- These times are plotted to display the linear and logarithmic graphs
