# Plot the Runtimes of Binary vs Linear search and Bubble vs Selection Sort

- This program uses matplot library to display the differing runtime complexities of Binary vs Linear search and Bubble vs Selection Sort.
- Binary and Linear algorithms are implemented in Assignment1
  - A file is read: it contains increasingly large lines of sorted numbers
- Bubble and Selection algorithms are implemented in Assignment2
  - A file is read: it contains increasingly large lines of unsorted numbers 
- The search algorithms are run on each line, and timed respectively
- These times are plotted to display the linear and logarithmic graphs
